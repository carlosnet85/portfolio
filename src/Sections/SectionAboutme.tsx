          Hey there! I'm Carlos Victor, a full-stack developer (kinda). I started with
          Arduino boards and quickly got interested by diving into some
          SoloLearn C++/C# courses. My stupidity led me up further, where I
          ended up getting into on databases and web development. You'll mostly
          find me working with Java and JavaScript, but I also work with C++ â€”
          I've got about a year of experience with it, thanks to some cool
          Arduino projects. My lifetime of coding stands at two years (so far).
